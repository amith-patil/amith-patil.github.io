            Back in 2010, I got my first computer and was immediately mesmerized by the technology. This evolved into me
            exploring the realm of Computers where I taught myself to build, troubleshoot and code. 
            <br><br>
            I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering in 2016, and worked as a Support Engineer at Dell EMC,
            where I explored working with NAS servers, Linux distributed Systems and Web development.
            <br><br>
            3 Years ago, I joined Google as one of their first Solutions Enginner for a new CyberSecurity Offering known
            as Google Secops ( formerly Google Chronicle ) in the APAC/EMEA Region. 
            <br><br>
            Outside of work, I enjoy Video games, Motorcycles,Videography and hanging out with my Wife and Cat.
